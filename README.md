# Third version of pizza website with small amount of JavaScript functionality added.
### This website uses HTML/CSS3/JavaScript without the use of grid or flexbox. Takes advantage of display and text alignment properties, as well as a linear gradient for the background image. This page also makes use of the position properties to align the main header and paragraph. Javascript is implemented to change a navigation link's border when hovered over/not hovered over.
